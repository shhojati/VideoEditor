# Progress

## Phase 0 — Spikes ✅ (2026-10-20)

See [SPIKES.md](SPIKES.md). Decode, MP4 export (H.264 + AAC) and Persian canvas text pass. Whisper runs fully offline.
Decision: ship tiny / base / small, with **small as the default for Persian**, and rely on the review step for corrections.

## Phase 1 — Skeleton and data model ✅ (2026-10-20)

### Done
- Vite 8 + React 19 + TypeScript 6 + Tailwind 4; ESLint (flat config, typescript-eslint, react-hooks), Prettier, Vitest (jsdom + fake-indexeddb).
- Folder layout from plan §4.3 (`src/app`, `store`, `model`, `engine/*`, `workers`, `features/*`, `lib`, `i18n`).
- **Model** (`src/model`): types per plan §4.2 (plus `TextProps`), factories with aspect presets (16:9 default, 9:16, 1:1, 4:5), zod validation with readable error paths, versioned migrations (`CURRENT_VERSION = 1`).
- **Undo/redo** (`src/store/history.ts`): Immer patches, 200-step limit, `mergeKey` to collapse continuous edits (slider drags) into one step, no-op edits are not recorded. Every project change goes through `useProjectStore().edit(labelKey, recipe)`; labels are i18n keys so the Undo tooltip is translated.
- **Persistence** (`src/store/persistence.ts`, `autosave.ts`): IndexedDB via `idb`; debounced autosave (400 ms) plus flush when the tab is hidden; save status shown in the top bar.
- **Projects** (`src/features/projects`): New / Open / Rename (inline) / Delete (with confirm). Startup reopens the last project; corrupt or too-new projects are skipped with a visible error.
- **Shell**: top bar, media bin, preview canvas (letterboxed to the project aspect), inspector (aspect + fps, undoable), timeline with track headers (add/remove/mute/lock, undoable). Timeline and preview stay LTR in the Persian UI.
- **i18n**: `fa` (default, RTL) and `en`; `<html dir/lang/title>` follow the language; choice remembered in localStorage.
- Shortcuts: Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+Y, Ctrl+Shift+Z (text fields keep native undo).
- Startup notice when WebCodecs / OffscreenCanvas are missing (non-Chromium browsers).

### Verified
- 22 unit tests (history, migrations, validation, session: first start, reload restore, autosave, delete fallback, corrupt project, double bootstrap).
- In the browser: rename + add track + aspect change → reload → restored; Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Y on aspect; fa ↔ en switch; no horizontal overflow at 800 px.

### Bugs found and fixed during verification
- Edit recipes that returned a value (e.g. `p => Object.assign(...)`) made Immer throw → `edit` now discards return values (test added).
- React StrictMode ran startup twice and created two projects → `bootstrap` is idempotent (test added).

### Deferred / known issues
- Radix UI not added yet; the project menu is a small custom popover and delete uses `window.confirm`. Add Radix when Phase 3/5 need dialogs, sliders and menus.
- Playwright is not set up yet — Phase 3's DoD needs it (plan wants the preinstalled Chromium).
- CI (lint, typecheck, tests) not configured; no remote repository yet.
- Environment: C: drive is full; this repo uses `.npmrc` → `cache=D:/repos/.npm-cache`, and commands set `TEMP=D:\repos\.tmp`.

### Next: Phase 2 — Media import and bin
First task: drag-and-drop / file picker import that probes metadata with Mediabunny (`Input.computeDuration`, primary video/audio track, codec + `canDecode`) and stores the original file in OPFS, adding an `Asset` through `edit()`.
